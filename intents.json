Select a topic you're interested in learning about and write it at the top of a blank page in a notebook. <br><br> 2. Teach it to yourself or someone else. Write everything you know about a topic out as if you were explaining it to yourself. Alternately, actually teach it to someone else. <br><br> 3. Return to the source material if you get stuck. Go back to whatever you're learning from a book, lecture notes, podcast  and fill the gaps in your knowledge.<br> <br>4. Simplify your explanations and create analogies. Streamline your notes and explanation, further clarifying the topic until it seems obvious. Additionally, think of analogies that feel intuitive."

        "For sure , here all you need to know about The Cornell Method : <br><br>  The Cornell Method is a note-taking system that involves dividing a piece of paper into three sections: a narrow column on the left-hand side for cues or questions, a wider column on the right-hand side for notes, and a space at the bottom for a summary. The method is used to help students and professionals effectively capture and retain information from lectures, readings, and other sources. To use the Cornell Method, begin by writing the name of the lecture or topic at the top of the page. During the lecture or reading, write notes in the right-hand column, using abbreviations and symbols to save time. After the lecture, review the notes and create questions or cues in the left-hand column to help you remember key points. Finally, write a brief summary of the lecture or reading in the space at the bottom of the page. This method can be a helpful tool for active learning and retention of important information. <br><br> here an example of that <a href=\"https://www.unine.ch/files/live/sites/blog/files/pic/Cornell_feuille.png\" target=\"_blank\">NOTE</a> "

        "SQ3R is the acronym for Survey, Question, Read, Recite, and Review, which are the five steps proposed by Robinson when actively and effectively reading one specific text. Here the five steps to folow : <br><br> Survey (S): initially, the readers start by reviewing the assigned text in order to gain an initial understanding of it by paying attention to its most obvious elements, such as headings, bolded text, or available charts. This first skim provides readers a framework for what will be presented in the text.<br><br>Question (Q), also called Query: from this initial preview, the readers are in the disposition to start generating questions about the content of the text. For example, they could convert the titles into questions, or they could create more general questions such as 'what is this text about?' or 'how could the content of this text be beneficial for me?'.<br><br>Read (R1): as the readers engage in the reading of the text itself, they do it actively, having as a background the work done in the two previous steps. Thus, the questions which were generated during the preview of the text help readers to focus. <br><br> Recite (R2), also called Retrieve or Recall: as readers move through the text, they recite or rehearse the answers to their initial questions, using their own words. This can be done either in an oral or written form, and it is aimed to support the personal formulation and conceptualization of the content of the text.<br><br>Review (R3): after the reading is completed, readers review the content of the text by repeating back to themselves what the main ideas of the text were, by using their own words."

" The Method of Loci, also known as the Memory Palace technique, is a mnemonic device used to improve memory and recall. Here s how it works in a few steps:  <br><br> 1. Choose a familiar location: Start by selecting a place you know well, such as your home or office. This location will be your \"memory palace.\"  <br><br> 2. Create a mental map: Visualize the different rooms, objects, and details of your chosen location. This mental map will serve as a framework for storing and retrieving information. <br><br> 3. Associate information with specific locations: To remember a list of items or concepts, associate each one with a specific location or object in your mental map. For example, if you wanted to remember a grocery list, you might associate each item with a different room in your home. <br><br> 4. Create vivid mental images: To enhance the effectiveness of the method, create vivid mental images that link the information to the location. For example, if you needed to remember to buy bananas, you might imagine a giant bunch of bananas hanging from the ceiling of your kitchen. <br><br> Here a video explain this method : <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ESBJLbRwJY\" target=\"_blank\">YOUTUBE</a>"
